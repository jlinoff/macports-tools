# macports-tools
Contains tools for installing and updating macports.

I use these tools pretty frequently and thought that others might find them useful.

The available tools are defined in the table below.

| Tool | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| macports-install.sh | Installs a new version of macports in /opt/macports/VERSION and creates the /opt/macports/latest link. |
| macports-update.sh | Updates the macports installation in /opt/macports/latest. |

Each tool has a help option (-h or --help) that provides more detailed information about the tool capabilities.
